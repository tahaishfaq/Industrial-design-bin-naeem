# Message to Client – Items We Need From You

**Subject:** Bin Naeem Industries website – information needed to complete remaining features

---

Dear Client,

To finish the remaining website features from our scope, we need the following from your side. Once we have these, we can complete analytics, compliance, and conversion tracking.

---

## 1. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Measurement ID

We will integrate GA4 for traffic and conversion tracking (form submissions, phone and email clicks, WhatsApp CTA).

**Please provide:**
- Your **GA4 Measurement ID** (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`).

**How to get it:**  
Google Analytics (analytics.google.com) → Admin → Data Streams → select your web stream → copy the “Measurement ID”.

If you don’t have a GA4 property yet, we can use a placeholder and you can add the ID later.

---

## 2. Google Search Console verification

We will add the verification tag so your site can be linked to Google Search Console (for indexing and search performance).

**Please provide:**
- The **verification meta tag** or **verification string** that Google Search Console gives you when you add the property (e.g. when you choose “HTML tag” as the verification method).

**How to get it:**  
Google Search Console (search.google.com/search-console) → Add property → choose “HTML tag” and copy the `content="..."` value.

---

## 3. Company profile PDF (for “Download company profile”)

The scope includes a “Download company profile” button. We need the final PDF file to host on the site.

**Please provide:**
- One PDF file: **company profile / corporate profile** (single document, final or near-final version).

**We will:**  
Place it on the site and add a “Download company profile” link on the Contact page (and optionally Leadership). If the PDF is not ready yet, we can add a placeholder link and you can replace the file later.

---

## 4. Optional – Real testimonials

The homepage has a testimonials section. Right now it uses placeholder text. For “real testimonial integration” as per scope:

**If you have them, please send:**
- Client name (and company/title if you want them shown).
- Short quote (1–3 sentences).
- Permission to publish on the website.

We will replace the placeholders with these. If you prefer to keep placeholders for now, we can leave the section as is and update it later.

---

## 5. Optional – Brand-specific WhatsApp numbers

The scope mentions “brand-specific routing (if possible)” for the WhatsApp CTA. Currently we use one main number site-wide.

**If you want different numbers per brand:**  
Please send the WhatsApp number (with country code, no spaces) for each brand that should have its own number. We will route the floating WhatsApp button and contact links accordingly.

**If you prefer one number for the whole site:**  
No action needed; we will keep the current setup and add tracking (UTMs) to the existing link.

---

Please reply with the items above (or confirm which ones are not ready yet). Once we have 1–3, we can complete the remaining technical work. For 4 and 5, we can proceed in a later phase if needed.

Best regards,  
[Your name / team]
