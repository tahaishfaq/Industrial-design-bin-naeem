# SEO Keywords – Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the **keyword list per brand** and **keyword mapping sheet** deliverable from the client scope document.

## How to use

- **Keyword list per brand:** List target keywords for each brand (Naeem Packages, Box Pack, Mondsub, NS Builders, House of Piñatas, Hanplas) and for the group site.
- **Keyword mapping:** Map which keywords are targeted on which pages (e.g. homepage, capabilities, each brand landing page, blog posts).

The client or SEO team can fill this document or replace it with a spreadsheet (e.g. CSV or Google Sheet) and link it here.
